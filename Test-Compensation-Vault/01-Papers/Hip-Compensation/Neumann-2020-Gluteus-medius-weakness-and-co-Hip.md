# Gluteus medius weakness and compensation patterns in hip pathology

## 📋 Study Overview
- **Journal:** Physical Therapy (2020)
- **DOI:** 10.1093/ptj/example
- **Quality Score:** 8.5/20
- **Citations:** 45

## 🔍 5WHY Analysis

### 1차 WHY: Why does hip pathology occur?
**Answer:** Gluteus medius weakness leads to altered movement patterns
**Evidence:** EMG analysis showed 40% reduction in gluteus medius activation



## 🎯 Compensation Pattern
**Pattern:** Hip Abductor Weakness Pattern
**Primary Dysfunction:** Gluteus medius weakness
**Compensatory Strategy:** TFL overactivity and hip hiking

## 🏥 Clinical Significance
High clinical relevance for hip rehabilitation

## 💡 Key Treatment Points
- Strengthen gluteus medius
- Address TFL tightness


## 🔗 Related Concepts
