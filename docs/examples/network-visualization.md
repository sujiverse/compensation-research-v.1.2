### **Clinical Interpretation**
```yaml
Compensation Cascade Analysis:
  Level 1 (Primary): Hip abductor weakness
  Level 2 (Regional): TFL substitution, hip drop
  Level 3 (Distant): Knee valgus, IT band tension
  Level 4 (Systemic): Ankle pronation, foot dysfunction

Treatment Priority:
  1. Address primary dysfunction (hip weakness)
  2. Retrain regional compensation (TFL overactivity)
  3. Restore kinetic chain function (knee alignment)
  4. Optimize distal adaptations (ankle mobility)
