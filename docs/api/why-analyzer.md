# 🤔 5WHY Analyzer API

> **Deep causal analysis engine for compensation pattern research using 5WHY methodology**

## 🎯 Overview

The 5WHY Analyzer API provides systematic causal analysis of compensation patterns in human movement. It extracts root causes, mechanisms, and clinical implications from research papers using our specialized 5WHY framework for physical therapy and biomechanics.

    evidence: "MRI shows muscle atrophy; strength testing confirms 60% weakness"

  WHY 3:
    question: "Why did the hip joint dysfunction develop?"
    answer: "Chronic hip impingement led to altered movement patterns and muscle deconditioning"
