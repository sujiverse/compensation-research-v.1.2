## 🎯 What is an Obsidian Vault?

An Obsidian vault is a structured collection of interconnected notes that forms a comprehensive knowledge base for compensation research. Our system automatically generates vaults that organize research papers, compensation patterns, anatomical concepts, assessments, and treatments into a wiki-style format with intelligent cross-linking.

### **Key Benefits**
- **Structured Organization:** Logical folder hierarchy for easy navigation
- **Cross-Linked Knowledge:** Concepts automatically connected based on relationships
- **Visual Discovery:** Graph view shows knowledge networks
- **Clinical Application:** Direct links from research to practice
- **Continuous Updates:** Vault grows with new research analysis
